Samsung Galaxy Camera Mute
==========================

A little shell script to mute the camera on a rooted Samsung Galaxy phone. It works on at least the S4 and S5.

### Requirements
- Your phone must be rooted (check out [towelroot](https://towelroot.com/) if it isn't)
- You have to have either a terminal app, or (preferably) SSH/Telnet access to your phone

### Usage
 - if you have a terminal or shell app on your phone, do these commands:
   - `su`
   - `curl -s raincoats.cat/mute/ | sh`
 - or you can just copy and paste [mute.sh](http://raincoats.cat/mute/) into an SSH session.

If something screws up, I have all the original sounds right here, in the backups folder.
