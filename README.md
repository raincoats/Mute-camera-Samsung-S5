Samsung Galaxy Camera Mute
==========================

A little shell script to mute the camera on a rooted Samsung Galaxy phone. It works on at least the S4 and S5.

### Requirements
- Your phone must be rooted (check out [towelroot](https://towelroot.com/) if it isn't)
- You have to have either a terminal app, or (preferably) SSH/Telnet access to your phone

### Usage
 - into your phone's terminal app, type `su`, press enter, then `wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/raincoats/Samsung-Galaxy-camera-mute/master/mute.sh -O- | sh`.

 - or you can just copy and paste [mute.sh](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/raincoats/Samsung-Galaxy-camera-mute/master/mute.sh) into an SSH session.
